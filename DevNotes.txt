Development Structure
---------------------

The source folder structure is required by the solution & projects to be like
this:-

+-FCManager
+-Lib
| +-Core
| +-MDBL
| +-WCL
+-Scripts

The following commands will create that structure by cloning the various
application and library repositories:-

C:\> mkdir Win32
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/FCManager.git Win32\FCManager
C:\> mkdir Win32\Lib
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Core.git Win32\Lib\Core
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/MDBL.git Win32\Lib\MDBL
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/WCL.git Win32\Lib\WCL
<optional>
C:\> git clone https://github.com/chrisoldwood/Scripts.git Win32\Scripts

Command Line Builds
-------------------

Included in the scripts folder is one for building via the command line:-

C:\> Win32\Scripts\SetVars vc71
C:\> Win32\Scripts\Build debug Win32\FCManager\FCManager.sln

There is also one for upgrading to a later version of Visual C++:-

C:\> Win32\Scripts\SetVars vc100
C:\> Win32\Scripts\Upgrade Win32\FCManager\FCManager.sln
